				&emsp;These visualizations analyze how the team makes attempts to score goals. The goal post shown below is a 
				regulation sized soccer goal post. <br><br>
				&emsp;In the late 2010, Barcelona were champions of the 'tiki-taka' style of football. <br>
				&emsp;• This style places strong emphasis on making short passes leading to goals scored from open play 
				<i><span class='red' style="font-size: small;">(select 'Open Play' in the Shot Type drilldown below to see this on the visualization).</span></i><br>
				&emsp;• Shots were typically taken from short distances, so players were able to score goals from both feet 
				<i><span class='blue' style="font-size: small;">(check the 'Technique' radio button to see this on the visualization).</span></i>

					<b> How to read this visualization: </b><br>
					The visualization on the left shows the spatial layout of shot attempts and their conversion to goals. <br><br>
					
					Each shot is denoted by a point drawn on the goalpost. <br><br>

					<span class='red'>Colored</span> points denote shot attempts that ended up in goal, while <br>
					<span class='bold'>Black</span> points denote attempts that were blocked or off-target. <br>
					<span class='faint'>Opacity</span> denotes a shot's xG (eXpectedGoals) statistic, a popular metric used to measure the likelihood of scoring. Easier shots have high xG and appear more solid, while harder shots have lower xG and appear more transparent.
